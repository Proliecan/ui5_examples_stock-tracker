## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is an example app written in OpenUI5 which aims to aid the learning and understanding of the framework.  
It is part of a series of Apps I wrote for this purpose. See more in its [GitHub Repo]([https://](https://github.com/Proliecan/ui5_examples)).

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

1. Clone the project via git:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Proliecan/ui5_examples
   ```
2. Get a `finnhub.io` api token
3. Copy the file `/webapp/model/api-tokens.format.json` as `/webapp/model/api-tokens.json`, open the file, paste in your api key and save the file.
4. Use a webserver to serve the application in `/webapp`.
In VSCode just use the Plugin `ritwickdey.LiveServer`.

### Prerequisites

- git
- A Webserver
- A `finnhub.io` api token

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

1. Don't
2. For long term usage I recommend to use a different API, a webcrawler or the paid tier of the `finnhub.io` api.
3. Serve the webapp in `/webapp` with a webserver of your choice. Popular options are `Apache2` and `nginx`.
4. Seriously. Don't.
